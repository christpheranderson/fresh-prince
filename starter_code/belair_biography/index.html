   <p><a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WEST_Philadelphia">In West Philadelphia</a>, born and raised, on the playground is where I spent most of my days:</p>
   <ul>
   	<li>Chilling Out</li>
   	<li>Maxing</li>
   	<li>Relaxing, all cool</li>
   </ul>

   <p>I was shooting some b-ball outside of the school when a couple of guys - they were up to <strong>no good</strong> -- started making trouble in my neighborhood.</p>

  <p>I got in <em>one little</em> fight and my mom got scared. She said, "You'll move in with your Auntie and your Uncle in Bel-Air."</p>
